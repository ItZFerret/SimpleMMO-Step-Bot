# SimpleMMO-Step-Bot
Super simple.. SimpleMMO step bot.

This bot utilizes the undetected chrome driver and looks for the step button, and presses it.

It will also detect when the human verification comes up after a step, and the program will pause. I recommend checking in on the bot once every 10-15 minutes, doing the captcha, and typing "c" in the console window to continue the loop. You will also be notified when you find an item.

I've been running this from level 2-3 up until level 80~ now and have had zero issues.

Should work just fine on Win10/11.

Let me know if you have any issues and I'm happy to help.

Download the latest version of Python, make sure you tick install to PATH.
Run the run.bat found in the file you've downloaded, this will install all the needed requirements for the scripts.
Access the web panel (should pull up automatically)
login with your SimpleMMO account, and enjoy!
