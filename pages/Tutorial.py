Step 1: Enter your Login information

Step 2: Just enter your webhook into the panel where it asks for "Webhook URL". You can create this in your discord server by going to server settings > integrations > webhooks

Step 3: Select how many hours you'd like to run the bot.

Step 4: Agree to the terms.

Step 5: Run the bot.


If verification is detected, you will receive a desktop and discord notification. If this happens, open the browser window where SimpleMMO is running
and select "Perform Verification", once the captcha is solved, you may open the console window and type the letter "C" to continue the bot.
